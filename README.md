## Introduction

The **Binance Divergence Detection** script uses the Binance API to pull price data for all futures trading pairs. It calculates the Relative Strength Index (RSI) using the `ta` library and checks for divergences. Upon detecting a bullish or bearish divergence, the script sends a notification to a specified Telegram chat using a bot.

## Features

- Fetches real-time market data for all Binance futures trading pairs.
- Calculates the RSI for each pair using the `ta` library.
- Detects bullish and bearish divergences based on price action and RSI values.
- Sends real-time notifications to a Telegram chat when a divergence is detected.
